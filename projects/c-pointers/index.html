    <h2>The C Pointers Game - Pointers, Arrays and Strings</h2>

    One of the most difficult concepts to grasp in modern programming is the difference between value and reference. This game tries to help with that. The parent has to know a bit of C to play.

    The parent has to know a bit of C to play, the game has 6 cards explaining the concepts of character, arrays, pointers and strings, but it won't be enough particularly because of the overloaded and confusing &*()[] usage in the language. So you will have to help a bit reading the code. Some of the cards are harder than others, and there is one that is just bizzare. All the code on the cards was compiled, and the output was used to create the string value in memory and the pointers to it.


    If you are a parent teaching your kid, and is exploring more tools to help you, I made few other card games:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://punkjazz.org/programming-time/">programming time</a>, which is a game to teach python and some more fundamental algorithms, from hash tables to RSA</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/4917/">4917</a>, a game to teach kids machine code and how the cpu works with memory and registers</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jackdoe/programming-for-kids/blob/master/book.md">programming for kids</a>, a log of my journey of teaching my 11yo daughter how to code</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/unix-pipes/">The Unix Pipes Game</a>, a game to teach kids to use basic UNIX commands: <code>cat, sort, grep, head, tail, wc, uniq<code></li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/unix-pipes/ext-0.1">The Unix Pipes Game - Process Substitution</a>, an expansion of the unix pipes game to teach process substition and also: <code>paste, tr, cut, bc<code></li>
    </ul>


    I would recommend to get also the Machine Code game, because it might help you as well.<br>

    This is how the card decks look:
