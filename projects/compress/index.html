    The goal of this game is to teach kids about compression and patterns, encoding pixels as numbers, then finding patterns in those numbers. My daughter's favorite anime is Naruto, so we used symbols from it as examples of images. The first 10 or so cards explain the concepts of "pixels" (which in this case are just ascii symbols), encoding them as numbers, runlength encoding and also averaging multiple "pixels", but its only so much that can fit in ~1000 characters, so its better if the parent undestands the concepts well and can show more examples of compression and patterns in day-to-day life (e.g. encoding the flag of your country, or black and white versus colored images and etc).

    Its more of a puzzle than an actual game, but I think it conveys the concept of compression and encoding really well.<br>

               GAME RULES               

This game is more of a puzzle than a
game. You can play it alone, or with
friends, but try to start with the easy
and obvious cards.

Remember that it is actually very
difficult to read the encoded images, so
do not get discouraged, and just try it,
one card at a time.

> 1. WATCH NARUTO IF YOU HAVENT

> 2. PICK AN IMAGE CARD

> 3. FIND THE ENCODING CARD
     MATCHING THE OUTPUT IMAGE

> 4. <font color="red">IF</font> YOU ARE HAVING FUN <font color="red">GOTO</font> 2

> 5. WATCH:

     Hunter x Hunter
     One Piece
     Bleach
     One Punch Man
     Dragonball Z
     Fairy Tail
     My Hero Academia
     Sword Art Online
