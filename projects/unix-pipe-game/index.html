    <h1>The UNIX Pipe Card Game</h1>

    This is a card game for teaching kids how to combine unix commands through <mark>pipes</mark>.<br><br>
    This game assumes the parent knows the basic unix commands: <code>cat, grep, tail, head, wc, sort, uniq</code>. The parent should show also show those commands in action the computer as well, if you do not have any UNIX system you can use <a href='https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192'>jslinux</a> in your browser.

    If you are a parent teaching your kid, and is exploring more tools to help you, I made few other card games:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://punkjazz.org/programming-time/">programming time</a>, which is a game to teach python and some more fundamental algorithms, from hash tables to RSA</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/4917/">4917</a>, a game to teach kids machine code and how the cpu works with memory and registers</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jackdoe/programming-for-kids/blob/master/book.md">programming for kids</a>, a log of my journey of teaching my 11yo daughter how to code</li>
    </ul>

    Example game round:

    <dl>task: <b>print the most common line from a file</b>, we need to first cat the file (in our case the file is card 03.txt), then sort it, uniq count it, then do numeric sort, then tail -1:
      <br>
<br>
    <b>cat 03.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -1</b></dl>

RULES:

  > 0. The youngest player decides the
    objective:

  * Whoever has the smallest pipe chain to
    complete the task wins the round.
  * Whoever has the largest pipe chain to
    complete the task wins the round.

  > 1. The youngest players picks a task
    from the tasks card. You can not pick
    the same task twice.

  > 2. Shuffle the deck.

  > 3. Put the deck face down on the
    table.

  > 4. Going clockwise each player picks
    the top card from the deck.

  > 5. The player who's at turn now tries
    to complete the task.

  > 6. The first player who completes the
    task gets a point.

  > GOTO 1.

    This is how the card decks look:
