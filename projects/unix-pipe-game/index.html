    <h1>The UNIX Pipe Card Game</h1>

    This is a card game for teaching kids how to combine unix commands through <mark>pipes</mark>.<br><br>
    This game assumes the parent knows the basic unix commands: <code>cat, grep, tail, head, wc, sort, uniq</code>. The parent should show also show those commands in action the computer as well, if you do not have any UNIX system you can use <a href='https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192'>jslinux</a> in your browser.

    If you are a parent teaching your kid, and is exploring more tools to help you, I made few other card games:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://punkjazz.org/programming-time/">programming time</a>, which is a game to teach python and some more fundamental algorithms, from hash tables to RSA</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/4917/">4917</a>, a game to teach kids machine code and how the cpu works with memory and registers</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jackdoe/programming-for-kids/blob/master/book.md">programming for kids</a>, a log of my journey of teaching my 11yo daughter how to code</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/c-pointer-game/">The C Pointer Game - Pointers, Arrays and Strings</a>, a game to teach kids to look at the computer memory and understand references and values</li>
    </ul>

    If you want to play the <b>more difficult</b> version, you can also get the Expansion pack: <a href="ext-0.1/index.html">UNIX Pipe Game - Process Substitution</a><br>

    Example game round:

    <dl>task: <b>print the most common line from a file</b>, we need to first cat the file (in our case the file is card 03.txt), then sort it, uniq count it, then do numeric sort, then tail -1:
      <br>
<br>
    <b>cat 03.txt | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -1</b></dl>
