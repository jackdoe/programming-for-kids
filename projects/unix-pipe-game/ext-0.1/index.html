    <h1>The UNIX Pipe Card Game: Process Substitution</h1>

    This is an expansion to <a href="../index.html">The Unix Pipe Game</a> with much more difficult tasks, and it adds <code>paste, tr, cut, bc</code> as commands. <br>

    The expansion assumes that the parent is familiar with the basic unix commands: <code>cat, grep, tail, head, wc, sort, uniq, <b>paste, tr, cut, bc</b></code>. The parent should show also show those commands in action the computer as well, if you do not have any UNIX system you can use <a href='https://bellard.org/jslinux/vm.html?url=alpine-x86.cfg&mem=192'>jslinux</a> in your browser.

    <b>NB:</b> <mark>You can not play this expansion without having the base game</mark>, the reason is the tasks require far more
    cards and there is just no space in one deck. <mark>I am sorry</mark>, I really tried to make the deck self contained, but in the end I decided to go with 2 decks so the game becomes more fun.<br>

    The concept of process substitution is explained briefly in the deck, also the new commands are briefly explained as well, but I can only explain so much in ~1000 characters, this will surely not be enough to explain to your kids, so its better to let them play a bit in the command line to get a feeling about how <code>paste, tr, cut, bc</code> work.<br>


    If you are a parent teaching your kid, and is exploring more tools to help you, I made few other card games:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://punkjazz.org/programming-time/">programming time</a>, which is a game to teach python and some more fundamental algorithms, from hash tables to RSA</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/4917/">4917</a>, a game to teach kids machine code and how the cpu works with memory and registers</li>
      <li><a href="https://punkx.org/c-pointer-game/">The C Pointer Game - Pointers, Arrays and Strings</a>, a game to teach kids to look at the computer memory and understand references and values</li>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/jackdoe/programming-for-kids/blob/master/book.md">programming for kids</a>, a log of my journey of teaching my 11yo daughter how to code</li>
    </ul>

    Example game round:

    <dl>task: <b>compute the average rating: <span style="color:red">sum(rating)</span>/<span style="color:blue">(amount of movies)</span></b>, so first we will make one process to cat the file, take the ratings column, skip the header, join the lines with + and pipe it into the calculator, we also need to count the amount of movies we have in the file, then we will use <code>paste</code> to join those outputs with '/' and pipe it again into the calculator:
      
      <br>
<br>
    <b>paste -d/- &lt;(<span style="color:red">cat 03.txt  | cut -f 4 -d, |grep -v Rating| paste -sd+ | bc</span>) &lt;(<span style="color:blue">cat 03.txt  | grep -v Rating | wc -l</span>) | bc</b></dl>
