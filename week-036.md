## [DAY-246] strings

# make a function to count how many times a given character

    # example string s "hello"
    # example character c "l"

## [DAY-247] lists

![game-247.jpg](./screenshots/game-247.jpg "game 247 screenshot")

```
* ask the user to name 3 friends
* ask the user to input 3 numbers for their age
* print each name with its age

HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

name> Jacki
name> Penny
name> John
age> 11
age> 10
age> 3

Jacki is 11 years old
Penny is 10 years old
John is 3 years old


HINTS:

* use for i in range(3) to get input 3 times
* use names.append(...) to append something to the list names
* if you have the list names and the list ages, think about what you
  have on index 0 in each list, e.g. names[0] and ages[0]
  again, use for i in range(3) to do something 3 times
  and think about the value of 'i' in the for loop and how you can use
  it to access the correct index from the lists
```

## [DAY-248] lists

```
* ask the user to name 5 book
* ask the user which year each book was published
* ask the user to enter each book's author
* print each book with its author and year

HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

book> Tom de Groot 1
book> Tom de Groot 2
book> Tom de Groot 3
book> Tom de Groot 4
book> Sam
year> 1996

HINTS:

* use for i in range(5) to get input 5 times
* use authors.append(...) to append something to the list authors
* if you have the list names and the list ages, think about what you
  have on index 0 in each list, e.g. authors[0] and years[0] and books[0]
  again, use for i in range(5) to do something 5 times
* use f strings (format strings) to print
  e.g.

  a = 1
  b = 'zzz'
  c = 6
  print(f"banana: {a}, apple: {b}, hello: {c}")

  will print "banana: 1, apple: zzz, hello: 6"
```

## [DAY-249] lists

```

  book's title
  book's author
  book's year


HOW IT SHOULD LOOK:

```
UNIQUE WORD COUNT


read a file and count how many times each word appears
lets say we have the file "aaa.txt" with the following text:

What will we do with a drunken sailor?
What will we do with a drunken sailor?
What will we do with a drunken sailor?
Early in the morning!
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Early in the morning!
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Shave his belly with a rusty razor
Early in the morning!
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Way hay and up she rises
Early in the morning!


the output should be:

What: 3
will: 3
we: 3
do: 3
with: 6
a: 6
drunken: 3
sailor?: 3
Early: 4
in: 4
the: 4
morning!: 4
Way: 6
hay: 6
and: 6
up: 6
she: 6
rises: 6
Shave: 3
his: 3
belly: 3
rusty: 3
razor: 3

DICTIONARY:

        words = {}
        how to check if the key `sailor` exists in a dictionary:
            if "sailor" in words:
               print("yes")
            else:
                print("no")

        how to print all keys and values of a dictionary:

        for word in words:
            count = words[word] # get the value of each word
            print(f"{word}: {count}")
```


## [DAY-252] dictionaries

```
* UNIQUE INPUTS

ask the user to enter 10 strings, and after they are done,
print only the unique ones

> asda
> zz
> asda
...
unique inputs:
asda, zz


HINTS:

in a dictionary table, the keys are unique
a = {}
a["aaa"] = "hello"
a["aaa"] = "bzbz"
print(a["aaa"]) will print 'bzbz' because we will
overwrite the value for the key 'aaa'


* UNIQUE ELEMENTS IN A LIST

write a function, that takes a list of numbers, and returns a new list only with
the unique elements


def uniq(a):
    b = []
    # ...
    return b



print(uniq([1,2,1,1,1,1,2,2,1,1,1,1,3,4]))

# should print
# [1,2,3,4]

HINTS:
dictionary keys can be integers as well, e.g.:

a = {}
b = 88
a[b] = 5

print(a[b])
```

## [DAY-253] dictionaries

```
* COUNT

write a function to count how many times elements appear in a list

def count(a):
    b = {}
    # ....
    return b

print(count([1,2,1,1,"aaa","bbb",1,1,2,2,1,"aaa",1,1,1,3,4]))

# should print
# {1: 9, 2: 3, 'aaa': 2, 'bbb': 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}

HINTS:

to check if a key is in a dictionary use 'in':

d = {}
k = "hello"
if k in d:
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")


think about a dictionary table that looks like this:

key   | value
------+------
"aaa" | 2
1     | 9
...
```


## [DAY-254] memory

> The goal of today was to understand deeply what 'equals' means and what variables mean, we discussed the following code:

```
x = 3
y = 4

y = x
x = 6
print(y)
```

```
x = [1,2]
y = [3,4]

y = x
x.append(6)
print(y)
```

```
x = [1,[3,4]]
y = x[1][1]

x[1][1] = 6
print(y)
```

```
x = "abc"
y = x[1]

x = "def"
print(y)
```


Assuming very very simplfied memory model, but discussing the difference about value and pointer, and how pointers are just numbers of the address of the thing they point to. We used pen and paper, and I will attach the notes as we were talking through it, but you will have come up with your own way to explain it and use whatever you think is needed, e.g. you can use an array of cards to represent memory, or use minecraft to build a long line of blocks, or whatever works for you. We also spent fair bit of time on talking how the code is also in memory and it is not different than any value you store in memory. 

![game-254-a.jpg](./screenshots/game-254-a.jpg "game 254-a screenshot")
![game-254-b.jpg](./screenshots/game-254-b.jpg "game 254-b screenshot")
![game-254-c.jpg](./screenshots/game-254-c.jpg "game 254-c screenshot")
![game-254-d.jpg](./screenshots/game-254-d.jpg "game 254-d screenshot")

The main focus was on `x = 3` means: python will find some space in memory, lets say on address 13, and will put the value 3 there, later when I do `y = 4` it will do the same, find some empty place e.g. address 17, and put the value 4 there. So when I do `y = x`, it will actually load the value of address 13 in some register, and then put it on address 17, the processor does not know about x or y, it just knows addresses and what to do with them (load/store etc).

Now the big difference is when we do `x = [1,2]`, then first we need to put the list somewhere in memory, e.g. addr 20, and the value of x is actually the address of that list, so lets say x is on address 5, then the value on address 5 is actually 20, so when we do `y = x` it will just go to address 5, load the value in register, and then store it at wherever y is (e.g. address 15). So now both x and y point to address 20.

> at this point you have to listen and look at the body language and take your time, I also discussed how does it know if a value is a regular or an address, the difference between how python and C does it and other things, we also spent some time on the binary numbers and why a byte, or 8 bits, has 256 values.


## [DAY-255] memory


![game-255.jpg](./screenshots/game-255.jpg "game 255 screenshot")


As we were walking to the store, I used the pavement blocks to talk about arrays and how you get to specific index in an array, how arrays blocks have the same size, and the difference between lists and arrays, and why lists need pointers.

When we got home, I challenged her to open her computer and name all the components.



## [DAY-256] prank

Today we didnt have a lesson, but I started and minimized the following program on her computer:

```
import pyautogui
import random
import time

while True:
    pyautogui.write(' ')
    time.sleep(random.randint(10,20))
```

which randomly pressess the space bar every 10-20 seconds :D
